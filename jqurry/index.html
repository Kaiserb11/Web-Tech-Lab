            <h4>20 Covid Patients Dead At Delhi Hospital</h4>
            Jaipur Golden Hospital is the second hospital in Delhi to sent SOS over shortage of oxygen this morning.


            New Delhi: Twenty people died last night at the Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi due to shortage of medical
            oxygen, a top
            official at the hospital said today, highlighting the worsening situation in the national capital's
            hospitals.
            "We had been allotted 3.5 metric tons of oxygen from the government. The supply was to reach us by 5 in the
            evening, but
            it reached around midnight. By then, 20 patients had died," Dr. DK Baluja, Medical Director at Jaipur Golden
            Hospital,
            told NDTV.
            Earlier Moolchand hospital, in a tweet, appealed for urgent help from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief
            Minister
            Arvind Kejriwal and Lt Governor Anil Baijal. More than 130 Covid patients are on life support, it stressed.
            "Urgent sos help. We have less than 2 hours of oxygen supply @Moolchand_Hos. We are desperate have tried all
            the nodal
            officer numbers but unable to connect. Have over 135 COVID pts with many on life support #. @ArvindKejriwal
            @CMODelh
            i@LtGovDelhi @satinderjain26 @PMOIndia (sic)," read the tweet put out by Moolchand Healthcare this morning.
            The hospital
            has stopped admitting new patients till it resolves the issue, sources said.

            <h2>IPL 2021: Something is missing in our batting line-up, says Rohit Sharma</h2>
            Not surprisingly then the opposition bowling attacks have varied their pace, bowling a healthy percentage of
            slower
            balls and cutters banged on hard lengths. Against Hardik especially, bowlers have cut down on pace and
            challenged his
            ego. The Mumbai batter has fallen more than once for the bait, going for the big hits straightaway and
            ending up paying
            the price with his wickets. His highest score in this IPL has been 15 in five innings.

            The failure of the Pandya brothers, including Krunal, who has failed to play to the situation, has added
            pressure on
            Pollard, who usually can be dangerous when there is a good partnership going. While Sharma had shrugged off
            the batting
            failure after losing the tournament opener against the Royals Challengers, on Friday he conceded that Mumbai
            top order
            had to change their batting approach and strategy.
